Technologies used:

To create this social networking app I mainly used Ruby as well as some Javascript used in tandem with a translator API. Ruby was used to create the localhost server as well as the majority of functions and pages used in the program. I used javascript in the layout to allow any possible page to be translated into another language. To fully bring the app onto the web I will be using Heroku in order to push it up.

The approach I took was to firstly start by setting up the majority of pages that would need to be accessed such as the index page and login pages.

I would then set up my database and and the initial tables I would need such as my 'users' table and 'posts' tables. From there I would set up my user functions, namely my making a create a user function and a login function. Once this happens you will be allowed to make content.

Which brings me to the next step which is the content creation functions. Firstly I will make those functions and then display them in the gets. IN order to show them on an erb file I will often use .each loops.

From here I will add functionality that will allow someone to update or delete their posts if they are the ones that made them. 

Once this happens I will start actually forming CSS to make this networking app presentable. This will include fonts, image editing as well as other things.

Now I will add my translating function, since this is an app for internation residents of Australia it is necessary to have accessibility for those who may be ESL or do not speak English. This will completing using JS on html pages.

Next I will do finishing touches such as adding an about us page and resources page.

Unsolved problems would be utilising timestamps. Preferably I would have liked to have had timestamps but did not get the chance to add them. As well as generally making the app much more presentable with CSS.
